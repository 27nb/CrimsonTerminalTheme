<h1 align="center"> RED Fallout 4 Terminal Theme</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

This is my first ever attempt to mess with theming Discord, even if it is just a fork.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Installing betterdiscord themes is really easy!
- Go into discord's settings
- Go to "Themes"
- Click on "Open theme folder"
- Move the .theme.css file you downloaded into the folder you just opened
- Click the checkbox in the top-right corner of the theme in discord to enable it

<h2>Customization</h2>

You can easily customize this theme by editing the .theme.css file! Just change the variables to whatever you want!
If you need help finding the right value(s), head on over to [the theme's website](https://B4T3S.github.io/Fallout4TerminalTheme/) which has a handy color-picker!

<h2>Need more help?</h2>

No worries! Just head on over to my [null], you'll be sure to find whatever help you need customizing over there! :)

<h2>Want to support me?</h2>
If you want to support me, well you can't, I'm no greedy bastard.
